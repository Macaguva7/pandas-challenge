Pycityschools is an analysis and comparison of how Reading and Math scores are different per sudent and district and charter school.

Analysis
The size of the data to be analyzed responds to fifteen (15) schools and their performance on Math and Reading scores.
For the whole size we can review how Reading scores are better than Math scores.
District schools have more students than Charter schools.
Math scores in general are lower than Reading scores for all grades (9th â€“ 12th).
Schools that have more students spend more budget per student but the results in Math and Reading are not better.
Conclusions from the calculations:
1.	 If we look at the % Overall Passing, we can conclude that the highest five (5) -Performing Schools are Charter schools and the Bottom five (5) District Schools.
2.	We can conclude that Charter schools have better scores in both Math and Reading school performance.
